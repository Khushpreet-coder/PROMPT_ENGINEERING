## üìò Key Learnings
- **A Good prompt** = **Role + Clear Instruction + Context + Format + Constraints**.

- Types of Prompts:
  1. **Instruction-Based**- Tells the AI what to do clearly.
                           Example: "Explain cyber security in simple words."
    
  2. **Role-Based**- Ask the AI to act like someone.
                    Example: "You are a fitness trainer. Suggest a diet plan for weight loss."

  3. **Few-Shot**- Show 1-2 example of the task and ask AI to continue.
                  Example- Q: Capital of France? A: Paris
                           Q: Capital of Japan? A: Tokoyo
                           Q: Capital of Germany? A:??

  4. **Zero-Shot**- Give the task to AI without Examples.
                    Example: "Hello" Translate this to French.

  5. **Chain-of-Thought**- Ask AI to think step-by-step.
                      Example: "Explain how a cybercriminal hacks a system step by step."
 
  6. **Constraint-Based**- Add rules or limits to control the output.
                          Example: Write a tweet about summer sale
     
  7. **Reframing Prompts**- Rewrite Vague Prompts.
                           Example- ‚ùå "Tell me about climate change".
                                    ‚úÖ Explain three major cause of climate change in under 100 words.
